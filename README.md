    <h2>🔍 Brief Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        One of the biggest issues always prevailing in a developing country is the high unemployment rate which is always attributed to skill deficiency amongst the working population. In order to solve this problem, we have created a skill gap bridging platform for the future workforce. The primary goal of this platform is to ensure that youth is informed on the latest technologies and also trained in a more structured and relevant to employment manner. As our primary goal is the narrowing of the skills gap, our platform helps people become more employable and add value to the economy.

        <h2>🛠 Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>
        In a rapidly evolving job market, individuals often face challenges in identifying and bridging skill gaps to meet the requirements of their desired job roles. Traditional methods of upskilling lack personalization and fail to align with specific career aspirations, leaving users unsure of the most effective path forward.
