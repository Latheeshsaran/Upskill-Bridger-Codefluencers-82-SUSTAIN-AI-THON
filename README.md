# Skill Gap Bridging Platform

*An AI-powered solution to match skills with industry needs.*

---

## üîç Brief Introduction
The big issue that developing countries continue to experience to this date is high unemployment rate. This is widely blamed on large gaps in the skill level of the working population whereby skills possessed by individuals do not match with the demand in the market place. Whereas in early stages of economic development this gap remains relatively small, in constantly developing economies, this gap widens and many people, willing to work, cannot find satisfying employment.To solve this critical problem, we have designed skill gap-bridging platform which could help the future workforce to be equipped with necessary tools and training for it. This platform will help in making sure that young people are not only informed on the new developments in the technology world but also trained in ways that will meet current employment market. As the youth is offered structured, practical and industry related learning opportunities, knowledge and skills that increase their marketability in the labor market, the platform achieves the above objectives.The key motivation for this scheme is to reduce the skill gap and help in enhancing the skill level in a population as a whole. Doing so, the platform assists people in finding better jobs and consequently lessens unemployment and contributes to the economy‚Äôs development. Finally, it goes beyond helping the workers or stakeholders but also contributes immensely to the creation of value in the economy through a ready force to meet emerging job market challenges.

## üõ† Problem Statement
In today‚Äôs world and the world that is quickly changing, people cannot keep up with the changing trends in different industries. Skills needs for most positions of employment are rapidly changing and developing meaning many professionals and potential employees are often in doubt on how to close the gap between what they currently can do and what is expected of them in their target career fields. The identification of such gaps can be a big challenge if one cannot determine the qualifications needed for different positions in different careers. As such, having no mentor can become a hindrance to career promotion and job opportunities ‚Äì especially in the sectors and regions where the competition is high.This problem cannot be solved through regular training or generic training and development programs, or autodidacticism. These approaches are impersonal and do not allow persons to match their learning activities to their career goals and deficiencies. Furthermore, these methods always forget about the need to introduce new trends in this industry and expectations of employers. That is why people spend their time and money on courses or certificates that can be irrelevant to their work or career trajectory.In this regard, the problem to be solved is that currently there is no AI-based upskilling recommendation system that would offer relevant and targeted solutions. A system designed with advanced analytics and AI capabilities can assess skill deficiencies based on a person‚Äôs current work profile, or a particular field of interest, against the job description of different occupations in diverse fields. From there it can provide suggestions for online courses, certification, or workshops on from sites like Coursera or Udemy with the guarantee that the learning material is relevant to the user‚Äôs career path as well as the trends in the field.Most importantly, this approach does not only assist people in improving their position in the labor market but also helps them to progress in their jobs in response to their developmental requirements. The given system is beneficial because it provides a clear and meaningful route for acquiring new knowledge, thus helping users become more prepared for versatile demands of the working environment in terms of continuing a career for a long time.
